1. Introduction
“Call Your AI” (“we,” “our,” or “the Extension”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the Extension uses permissions and handles data. By installing or using the Extension, you agree to the practices described herein.

2. Data Collection

No Personal Data: We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal or sensitive information about you or your browsing activity.

Local Inputs Only: All queries you type (e.g. @chatgpt [your query]) are processed locally in your browser to determine which AI service to launch.

3. Permissions and Their Use

tabs / activeTab: Used solely to open or update browser tabs when you invoke an AI command (e.g. @claude [your query]).

host permissions: Limited to the specific AI domains you choose (e.g. https://chat.openai.com/*, https://www.perplexity.ai/*), enabling the Extension to pre‑populate or guide text insertion when site policies allow.

storage: Stores only your custom keyword settings and enabled/disabled service preferences locally in Chrome; nothing is synced to external servers.

We do not include any analytics, advertising, or telemetry libraries. There is no collection of usage metrics or sharing of data with third parties.
